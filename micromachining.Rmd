During the 2015-2016 school year, I worked with [Dr. Shiv Kapooor](https://mechanical.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/sgkapoor)  on a way to create low-cost lense molds for smartphone cameras.  The end result of the project was a toolholder providing manual horizontal adjustment for a TiAlN (Titanium Aluminum Nitride) coated bit.

The project was in collaboration with [FoxConn Interconnect Technologies](http://www.fit-foxconn.com/), the primary manufacturer of the iPhone. An axisymmetric specification of the 4x zoom lens is below.  Most iPhone's are $~7 mm$ in thickness with most of that space devoted to non-camera components.  A 4x zoom lens in the limited space available is possible, but only in the micrometer ($10^{-6} m$) space.  The lens specified below is $354.1 \mu m$ in diameter and $52 \mu m$ in depth.  As a point of comparison, the average human hair is $80 - 100 \mu m$ in width.

The lens mold itself is what we were tasked with making.  Each lens mold could be used to create many lenses by pouring in molten glass into the mold.  A CAD rendering of the lens mold is shown below.
