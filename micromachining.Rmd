During the 2015-2016 school year, I worked with [Dr. Shiv Kapooor](https://mechanical.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/sgkapoor)  on a way to create low-cost lense molds for smartphone cameras.  The project was in collaboration with [FoxConn Interconnect Technologies](http://www.fit-foxconn.com/), the primary manufacturer of the iPhone. An axisymmetric specification of the lens is shown below.
