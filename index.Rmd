title: "DataDiet"
---

I am a trained analyst passionate about the applications of machine learning to diverse realms of public and private enterprises.  Data is a diet and a lifestyle, I hope to spread my enthusian for it through this site. While analyzing data, I'm always finding an interesting angle to explore.  As I come across useful techniques or insightful lines of analysis in the course of my research, I like to document my findings to contribute to the greater knowledge and efficacy of other data analysts, engineers, and scientists.  I myself an agnostic to title and just think of myself as a 'curious individual.'  Feel free to shoot me an email at akiramadono@gmail.com.
